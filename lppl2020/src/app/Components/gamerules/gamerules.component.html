<p>11. Results of every poll will be updated in the leader board next morning.</p>
<p>12. If there happens any change in the Employee ID of a participant, he/she is requested to intimate Loyalty Cricket Council of IBS (referred to as LCCI here after) failing which there could be mismatches in the points table.</p>
<p>13. No editing in answers will be allowed once the form is submitted.</p>
<p>14. If a match is abandoned without any final result, then there will be no winners/points for that particular match.</p>
<p>15. If D/L method (Duckworth-Lewis) is applied in any of the rain hit matches, then the points of the participants will be evaluated based on the actual match result.</p>
<p>16. Scorecard shown in www.cricbuzz.com will be the website taken as reference for any IPL match.</p>
<p>17. Events like catches, runs, wickets etc scored in a super-over of the match in case of a tie will not be counted for the final poll evaluation.</p>
<p>18. Time, if mentioned anywhere, will follow the Indian Standard Time (IST). LCCI understands the difficulties faced by participants joining from an entirely different time zone. Regretting the inconvenience caused and expecting your whole hearted participation.</p>
<p>19. Forms are configured with an option to check/uncheck â€˜Send Receiptsâ€™. Checking this will trigger a mail to your inbox after submitting the poll which helps to cross check the answers submitted by you against the actual answers after publishing the results next day.</p>
<p>20. Any mail sent by LCCI with regard to this contest will start with the subject <strong>LPPL2020</strong> which will help you to organize rules for these mails in your inbox.</p>
<p>21. LCCI members will also be eligible to participate in the contest but will not be eligible for daily/weekly/mega winning list.</p>
<p>22. LCCIâ€™s decision will be final in deciding any winners or the daily match points. If any participant feels his/her points were calculated wrongly, could approach the LCCI with evident proofs.</p>
<p>23. If any of the questions in the poll have multiple/ambiguous answer after the match, LCCIâ€™s decision will be final in these cases.</p>
<p>24. LCCI comprises of Ramakrishnan Kolappan, Sanal Thomas, Shankar Maharajan, Shrikant S Nair and Vivekanand Krishnakumar Sreekumaryamma. Get in touch with any of them for any clarifications.</p>
<p>25. This is a small approach in keeping our iFly Loyalty team engaged with a daily fun intended activity during this lockdown period and trying out something different for the first time. Since this involves a lot of calculations, there could be cases where the points/standings would be displayed wrongly in the leader board. Request you to verify yourselves in such cases and get back to the LCCI so we can have a fair game forward.</p>
<p>26. This contest is purely based on your luck and fortune. Kindly do not lose your momentum if you do not qualify for the daily/weekly winning list. You have all the chances to try your luck for the Mega winning list. Looking forward to your support.</p>
